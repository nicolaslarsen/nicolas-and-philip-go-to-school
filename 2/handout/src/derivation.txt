Example from Text File

The Original Example

E ::= T '-' E | T
T ::= '0' | '1'

We can transform this with a left factorization into the following

E    ::= T Eopt
Eopt ::= '-' T Eopt | eps
T    ::= '0' | '1'

For Expression in the homework we have the following Grammar

Expr ::= Expr ',' Expr | Expr1

We can then similarly transfrom with the following equivalent grammer

Expr     ::= Expr1 | ExprOpt
ExprOpt  ::= ',' Expr1 ExprOpt | eps
Expr1    ::= .... | .... | ....
