Exercise 1
a) Correct
b) Correct, except I’d like an explanation your union bounds a la: “We make a union bound over all events of the form h(x)=h(y) where x≠y. There are |A|*(|A|-1)/2 such and they each occur with probability 1/m”

Exercise 2
I like your idea but it does not hold that X~Bin(|C|,k/|A|). Indeed we are sampling EXACTLY k elements but the binomial distribution can attain all values integral values between 0 and |C|. Instead, simply note that the probability that an element is being sampled is k/|A| so the expected number of elements sampled from C is |C|k/|A| using linearity of expectation.

Exercise 3
a)+b) You have to describe more precisely how you update your hash table — how do you make sure that it always contains only the bottom k elements? And when inserting a new, how do check if you should store it or throw it away? I don’t think a hash table is a good solution here.
I suggest you use a binary max-heap of order k. If you do that  you can in O(1) time check whether the new element should be inserted (by checking the maximum element) and in that case insert it in time O(lg k ) deleting the current maximum element too.



Exercise 4
a) I find your solution very hard to follow in particular your proof of the second inclusion. Divide it into simpler and trivial steps a long the lines of: “Let x \in S(A\cup B). Assume with no loss of generality that x\in A. Then being among the k smallest elements in A\cup B it is also among the k smallest elements in A i.e. in S(A)”.
Otherwise OK
b) This mayhem of symbols contains several typos and is extremely hard to follow without explanatory notes. I’d like something like the following much more: “Denote by LHS and RHS the left and right handside of the equation. That RHS\subset LHS is clear. To show the converse, take an x\in LHS. As x is in A\cap S(A\cup B) it is also in S(A). Similarly x in S(B). Finally it is clear that x in S(A\cup B). This completes the proof”
Otherwise OK


Exercise 5
More explanations please!
Why is |C \cap S|\leq (1+b)p|C|? This is the crucial observation and you should provide an observation.
Hint: Show that assuming (I) is false, you have that  |C \cap S| \leq |S_{h,p}(C)| where S_{h,p}(C) are the elements from C having hash values at most p. To see this note that when (I) is false, S will only contain elements below p and hence C \cap S \subset S_{h,p}(C). Now use (II) to conclude |C \cap S|\leq (1+b)p|C|.

Exercise 6
The third step in your calculations is incorrect: \mu_A-X_A>r\mu_A/sqrt(k) does not imply that \mu_A-X_A>r\mu_A. Instead use that k=(1-a)\mu_A\leq \mu_A
 and proceed as you (correctly) do in exercise 7

Exercise 7
Correct — but explanations please! You have to describe how you apply lemma 1.

Overall a good assignment. Many of your ideas are correct but you lack a lot of explanations! In general you should not answer an exercise using nothing but formulas. Explanatory plain text is a must so I can see you had the right ideas.
