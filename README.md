## Nicolas and Philip go to School

Two lost students at the University of Copenhagen were stumbling to find their way. By chance they found each other. Their names were Philip Lassen and Nicolas Larsen. They decided (naively it must be said) that they should be partners for their school work. This is their repo and these are their stories...

## Classes
----
## Advanced Programming 
* Use program structuring principles and design patterns, such as monads, to structure the code so that there is a clear separation of concerns.
* Use a parser combinator library to write a parser for a medium-sized language with a given grammar, including changing the grammar so that it is on an appropriate form.
* Use parallel algorithm skeletons such as map-reduce to write data exploring programs.
* Implement simple concurrent/distributed servers using message passing, with appropriate use of synchronous and asynchronous message passing.
* Use program structuring principles and design patterns for making reliable distributed systems in the presence of software errors.
* Write idiomatic programs in a logic programming language.

## Advanced Computer Systems
* System abstractions and design principles
* Modularity with clients and services
* Performance
* Atomicity and transactions
* Concurrency control and recovery
* Reliability, fault-tolerance, and redundancy
* Distributed protocols for replication
* Large-scale data processing

## Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms
* Graph algorithms such as max flow.
* Data structures such as van Emde Boas Trees.
* NP-completeness.
* Exponential and parameterized algorithms for NP-hard problems.
* Approximation algorithms.
* Randomized algorithms.
* Computational geometry.
* Linear programming and optimization.
